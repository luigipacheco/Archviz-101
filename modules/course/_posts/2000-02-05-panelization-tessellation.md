## Assignment 2.4 — Panelization → Dual Mesh → Tessellation

### Visualization Strategy
Final presentation board (plans, sections, renders, catalogues)

### Computational Theme
Surface subdivision (isotrim, panel extrusion), dual mesh operations, tessellation (triangular, hexagonal, Voronoi).

### Task

1. Panelize a doubly-curved surface; explore offset, split, extrusion, color mapping.
2. Apply dual mesh & tessellation logics to produce alternative tilings. Present a catalogue of outcomes (resolution, density, aperture, geometry).

### Deliverables
- 11"x22" board (process, catalogues, hybrid renders, sections, diagrams)
- GH/GeoNodes file
- Optional GIF animation of variations

### Extra Credit
Fabricate a tessellated panel prototype (laser cut or 3D print).

### Learning Objectives
- Master surface subdivision workflows
- Understand dual mesh operations
- Develop tessellation strategies
- Create comprehensive final presentations
- Bridge digital design with physical fabrication
