## Assignment 1 — Icebreaker: Modeling an Object

### Visualization Strategy
Object rendering

### Computational Theme
Basic 3D modeling, transformations, primitives

### Task
Model a real, physical object from scratch to establish skill baseline. Show the modeling process with diagrams.

### Deliverables
- 3D model
- 22"x11" board including:
  - Composite render
  - Pure render
  - Pure line
  - Process diagrams

### Extra Credit
Fabricate the object (3D print, CNC, or laser cut).

### Learning Objectives
- Master basic 3D modeling operations
- Understand transformation workflows
- Develop visualization presentation skills
- Establish baseline technical proficiency
