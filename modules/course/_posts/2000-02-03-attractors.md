## Assignment 2.2 — Attractors (Single → Multiple)

### Visualization Strategy
Gradient diagrams + catalogue of results

### Computational Theme
Attractor logic (single & multiple points/curves), distance-based influence, remapping, merge/flip matrix.

### Task

**Part 1**: Single attractor drives circle radius/geometry scale. Provide pseudocode for multiple attractors.

**Part 2**: Multiple attractors (points/curves) drive a field of geometries; compare results in catalogue format.

### Deliverables
For each part: 11"x22" board (process diagrams, scalar visualizations, catalogue), GH/GeoNodes file.

### Extra Credit
- **Part 1**: Pen-plot 2D attractor field.
- **Part 2**: 3D print a geometric sound panel where attractors modulate panel height or perforation.

### Learning Objectives
- Master attractor logic and workflows
- Understand distance-based influence systems
- Develop catalogue presentation skills
- Apply computational design to physical fabrication
