## Assignment 2.0 — Plotter Portrait: Lists → Lines → Toolpaths

### Visualization Strategy
Procedural line drawing (portrait + animated build-up)

### Computational Theme
Vertices & edges as data; list/tree manipulation; toolpath states (approach/draw/retract).

### Task
Convert an image/portrait into line strokes. Insert approach/retract moves (Z-hops) before and after each stroke so it can be plotted by a drawing robot.

### Deliverables
- 11"x22" board (process diagrams, legend for pen states, final visuals)
- Script image
- GH/GeoNodes file
- GIF

### Extra Credit
Pen-plot final portrait.

### Learning Objectives
- Master list and tree data structures
- Understand toolpath generation
- Develop procedural drawing workflows
- Bridge digital and physical fabrication
