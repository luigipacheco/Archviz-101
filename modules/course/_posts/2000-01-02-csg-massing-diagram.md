## Assignment 1.1 — CSG Massing Diagram (BIG-style)

### Visualization Strategy
Sequential axonometric diagrams

### Computational Theme
Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), non-destructive operations

### Task
Perform at least 5 operations on primitive solids to develop a massing strategy (programmatic, environmental, structural, or functional). Show the design logic step by step in axonometric diagrams.

### Deliverables
- 3D model
- 22"x11" board including:
  - Sequential axonometrics
  - Annotated intent
  - Final plan/section
  - Final axonometric

### Extra Credit
3D print final massing.

### Learning Objectives
- Master CSG operations and workflows
- Develop sequential design thinking
- Create clear design communication through diagrams
- Understand non-destructive modeling practices
