## Assignment 2.3 — Attractors → Panelization (Sound Panel Exercise)

### Visualization Strategy
Axonometric & rendered catalogue

### Computational Theme
Attractors combined with panelization logic

### Task
Develop a sound panel prototype where attractors modify panel size, thickness, or perforation. Present as catalogue of variations + physical prototype option.

### Deliverables
- 11"x22" board (workflow, attractor logic, variations, renders)
- GH/GeoNodes file

### Extra Credit
Fabricate a 3D-printed sound panel tile.

### Learning Objectives
- Combine attractor and panelization workflows
- Develop sound panel design thinking
- Create variation catalogues
- Bridge computational design with acoustic performance
