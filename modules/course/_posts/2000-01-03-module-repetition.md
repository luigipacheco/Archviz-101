## Assignment 1.2 — Module & Repetition (Anatomy of a Model)

### Visualization Strategy
Plan / Axonometric composition

### Computational Theme
Arrays and modular repetition

### Task
Digitize a measured module (real object, e.g. brick, façade unit). Replicate it with arrays or parametric repetition to generate complexity. Explore architectural language through aggregation.

### Deliverables
- 3D model
- 22"x11" board including:
  - 3 perspectives (composite render+line, render, line)
  - Orthographic plan & section
  - Sectional axonometric
  - One GIF (sun path or array growth)
  - Illustrator-polished drawings (line weight, annotation)

### Extra Credit
Fabricate a modular prototype (laser cut, CNC, or 3D print).

### Learning Objectives
- Master array and repetition workflows
- Develop parametric thinking
- Create professional presentation drawings
- Understand modular design principles
