# Course Overview

## Course Description

This course introduces students to architectural visualization methods through computational design. Each assignment emphasizes a visualization strategy (diagram, section, plan, render) while exploring a computational design concept (CSG, arrays, attractors, panelization, tessellation). Students will use both analog and digital workflows, and the course remains tool-agnostic: projects can be executed in Rhino/Grasshopper, Blender/Geometry Nodes, or similar platforms.

Throughout the semester, students will also explore how digital models can translate into physical outputs via 3D printing, CNC, laser cutting, or pen plotting.

## Learning Goals

- Understand fundamental 3D modeling operations and their role in architectural design
- Learn to communicate design strategies through diagrams, drawings, and renders
- Apply computational design principles (parametric logics, repetition, attractors, panelization)
- Develop workflows bridging digital design and fabrication

## Course Structure

The course is organized into two main modules, each focusing on specific computational design concepts and visualization strategies.

### Module 1: Introductory Modeling & Visualization Strategies
- **Assignment 1**: Icebreaker: Modeling an Object
- **Assignment 1.1**: CSG Massing Diagram (BIG-style)
- **Assignment 1.2**: Module & Repetition (Anatomy of a Model)

### Module 2: Data Structures, Attractors, and Surface Logics
- **Assignment 2.0**: Plotter Portrait: Lists → Lines → Toolpaths
- **Assignment 2.1**: Points & Lines
- **Assignment 2.2**: Attractors (Single → Multiple)
- **Assignment 2.3**: Attractors → Panelization (Sound Panel Exercise)
- **Assignment 2.4**: Panelization → Dual Mesh → Tessellation

## Grading Breakdown

- **Module 1 Assignments**: 40%
- **Module 2 Assignments**: 50%
- **Attendance & Participation**: 10%
- **Extra Credit (fabrication outputs)**: up to +10%
