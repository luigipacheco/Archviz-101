# Architectural Visualization 101

Welcome to **Architectural Visualization 101**, a comprehensive course that introduces students to architectural visualization methods through computational design. This course emphasizes both digital and analog workflows, remaining tool-agnostic while exploring fundamental computational design concepts.

## Course Overview

This course is structured around three main areas:

* **[Course](/modules/course/)** - Complete course content with assignments, learning objectives, and deliverables
* **[Tutorials](/modules/tutorials/)** - Step-by-step guides for software workflows and computational design concepts  
* **[Resources](/modules/resources/)** - Software downloads, reference materials, and community resources

## What You'll Learn

- **Fundamental 3D modeling operations** and their role in architectural design
- **Visualization strategies** including diagrams, sections, plans, and renders
- **Computational design principles** like parametric logics, repetition, attractors, and panelization
- **Digital-to-physical workflows** bridging design and fabrication

## Course Structure

The course is organized into two main modules:

### Module 1: Introductory Modeling & Visualization Strategies
- Basic 3D modeling and object rendering
- CSG massing diagrams and non-destructive operations
- Modular repetition and parametric arrays

### Module 2: Data Structures, Attractors, and Surface Logics
- Procedural line drawing and toolpath generation
- Point grids, networks, and attractor systems
- Surface subdivision, panelization, and tessellation

## Getting Started

1. **Review the [Course](/modules/course/)** section to understand assignments and requirements
2. **Check [Tutorials](/modules/tutorials/)** for software-specific guidance
3. **Explore [Resources](/modules/resources/)** for tools and reference materials
4. **Begin with Assignment 1** to establish your baseline skills
